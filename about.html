    <p>
        A chaotic little ecosystem where survival is more about sarcasm than skill. We run on bad jokes, worse decisions, and the kind of group chats that could end friendships and careers if leaked. Deadlines? We meet them the way pedestrians “meet” speeding buses — barely and with a story to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re equal parts drama, caffeine, and questionable life choices, held together by inside jokes no one outside our bubble would understand. If life’s a game, we’re playing it with low health, no map, and still somehow managing to win… mostly just to annoy everyone else.
